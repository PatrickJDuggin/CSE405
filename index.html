                 <p> This is the home page for my Research project </p>
                 
                 <p> I will be researching Common Gateway interface or CGI for short, not that one. For more information go to the research tab.</p>
                 
                 <p> Below are my course assignments </p>
                 
                 <p> assignment 1

1: fairly minimal, your previous class, a html class back in crafton, and some virtual machine oriented web design in 360, 365, and 366

2:  a reasonable understanding of web development beyond the basics, it is my hope that I will leave this class with a strong understanding of server programing

3:   I cannot say I am very confident in giving a lecture.

4: not sure I would have much to help with </p>

<p> Assignment 2,

I will be doing a research project regarding the common gateway interface. as someone who is looking to be system admin I feel it would be a very good use of my time this quarter to better identify communications. for my research I will try to gain a complete understanding of common gateway interface and write a  c++ script that conforms to common gateway interface standards
